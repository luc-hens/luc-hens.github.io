# Book recommendations (podcasts and board games, too)

(Work in progress; I plan to add a short annotation for each entry in the list.)

Here are some great books (mostly on economics and statistics) that I recommend. All are accessible to laypeople &mdash; it suffices to have an inquisitive mind. Most are available in the university library.

* Robert Heilbroner (1953). *The Worldly Philosophers*. Here's what *The Economist* (July 16, 2022, p. 73) writes: "The best book for anyone interested in the history of economic ideas---not least because it is short, conversational and can be read in a few hours. First published in 1953, it covers some of the most consequential early economists, from Adam Smith to Thomas Malthus to Karl Marx, explaining what they thought and why"
* Matt Ridley (2020). *How Innovation Works* [Add a short annotation]
* Hannah Ritchie (2024). *Not the End of the World: How We Can Be the First Generation to Build a Sustainable Planet*
