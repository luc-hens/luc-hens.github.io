# Book recommendations

(Work in progress; I plan to add a short annotation for each entry in the list.)

Here are some great books (mostly on economics and statistics) that I recommend. All are accessible to laypeople &mdash; it suffices to have an inquisitive mind. Most are available in the university library.

* Robert Heilbroner (1953). *The Worldly Philosophers*. Here's what *The Economist* (July 16, 2022, p. 73) writes: "The best book for anyone interested in the history of economic ideas---not least because it is short, conversational and can be read in a few hours. First published in 1953, it covers some of the most consequential early economists, from Adam Smith to Thomas Malthus to Karl Marx, explaining what they thought and why"
* Matt Ridley (2020). *How Innovation Works* [Add a short annotation]
* David Spiegelhalter (2019). *The Art of Statistics: Learning from Data.* [Add a short annotation]

* Tim Harford (2011). *The Undercover Economist*. ([Here](https://timharford.com/2022/02/the-ten-best-books-for-thinking-clearly-about-statistics/) are Tim Harford's *Ten best books for thinking clearly about statistics*.)
